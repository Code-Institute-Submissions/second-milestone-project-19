# Second Milestone Project - Super Mario All Stars - Beat The Clock!

**Version 1.0.0**

I choose to take the oportuntiy to exercise all my new Java Script knowledge alongside my learned skills on HTML5 and CSS3 for this Milestone Project by putting together this rather fun Memory Match card game with a personal favorite theme.
My goal with this project is to showcase my practical understanding of the JavaScript fundamentals, covering a large variarety of functions, events and utilising algorithms such as the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm, which i used on this project.

## UX

My UX process was based on trying to develop a simple, easy to the eye game, navigable layout enabling a logical and intuitive response for the user to play and achive the target explained on the top of the page.
At the initial stage of my UX design I used the already familiar Balsamiq wireframe, which allowed me to sketch a visual picture of which design will be more effective on achieving my desired result to the user.

The reason why you can see differences between my original wireframes and the actual page because changes happened during development process. I did not find the need to create any more detailed mockups because the design is so straight forward and I already had seen how my cards look together.

### User Feedback

-As the first time playing this game on Mario's web page, I found his memory card match game easy to play, user friendly and with intuitive navigation, the background music gave me an instant feel of nostalgia for Super Mario game
 the count down timer made the game even more exciting as you try to complete matching all the cards with less possible number of flips before the time is up! great fun!
Overall, it is a great effort but with room for improvement, the game can be enhance with adding difficulty levels and more sound effects.
 
-As a friend, i played from a link on my iphone and realise the game needed some fixes on the cards background as they were not fliping when clicking on the while using safari broswer.

## Testing

I have gone to a great length to make sure testing was done to the best of my abiliy. 

### Code Checking

I have checked and worked on all the necessary corrections to make sure all my pages where CCS3 And HTML5 approved, I had 0 errors on HTML5 and 0 on CSS3 to fix.

### Web Browsers

I have run my project on Firefox, Google Chrome, Brave and Safari and found no issues on desktop mode.

On Safari mobile view, I did found some issues on the background cards no fliping correctly on click, I managed to fix the page further, but it could still have a more smoother transition as you can see from the video test below.
